# Jaq's Best Ever Movie Guide - Project Summary

## 🎬 Project Overview

This is a conversational movie recommendation AI built to transform Jaq's curated movie collection from Notion into an intelligent, social platform where friends and family can discover movies through natural conversation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **UI**: HeroUI (NextUI successor) + vanilla styling fallback
- **AI**: Custom classification system (planned: Claude + OpenAI integration)
- **APIs**: TMDB for movie metadata enrichment
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 📊 Current Architecture

### Database Schema
```prisma
- Movie: Core movie data (title, TMDB metadata, posters, ratings)
- Recommendation: Links movies to users with status and notes
- Conversation: Tracks chat interactions and AI responses
```

### Key Features Built
- ✅ Parsed Jaq's 42-movie Notion collection with status tracking
- ✅ TMDB API integration for auto-enrichment
- ✅ Conversational chat interface with intent classification
- ✅ Admin panel for data import
- ✅ Social attribution (Jaq's picks vs community additions)

## 🎯 Current Status

### What's Working
- **Data Import**: Successfully parses Jaq's collection from Notion markdown
- **TMDB Integration**: Auto-fetches movie posters, ratings, and metadata
- **Basic AI**: Pattern-based classification for user intents
- **Database**: Enhanced schema with recommendations and conversations
- **Multiple UIs**: Both styled (/chat) and vanilla (/simple-chat) interfaces

### Recent Issues Resolved
- Fixed TypeScript/ESLint build errors (quote escaping, unused variables)
- Enhanced AI classification patterns for genre requests
- Added debug logging for intent classification
- Created fallback vanilla styling interface

### Pending Deployment Fix
- **Status**: Build errors fixed, pending git push due to shell environment issue
- **Files Ready**: All quote escaping fixed in simple-chat page
- **Action Needed**: Manual git push to deploy fixes

## 🧠 AI Classification System

### Intent Types
- **REQUEST_RECOMMENDATION**: "I'm feeling like a sci-fi movie"
- **SUBMIT_RECOMMENDATION**: "I just watched Dune and it was amazing"
- **DISCUSSION**: "What did you think of Inception?"
- **QUESTION**: Generic questions

### Pattern Matching
- Genre detection: sci-fi, horror, comedy, action, thriller, drama
- Status tracking: watched, watching, recommended, want-to-watch
- Enthusiasm levels: 1-5 scale based on language patterns

## 📥 Jaq's Collection Data

### Source Data (42 items)
- **Format**: Notion markdown with status indicators
- **Status Types**: ~~crossed out~~ (completed), (episodes), starting 😊
- **Personal Notes**: "this one is incredible and mind blowing!"
- **Types**: Mixed movies and series

### Sample Entries
```
- Inception (MOVIE, RECOMMENDED, Level 3)
- The fall of the house of Usher. (Episodes) this one is incredible! (SERIES, RECOMMENDED, Level 5)
- ~~Fresh~~ (MOVIE, COMPLETED, Level 3)
- Surface - starting 😊 (SERIES, WATCHING, Level 3)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
TMDB_API_KEY="Bearer_token_from_TMDB"
```

### Deployment Steps
1. **Import Data**: Visit `/admin` and click "Import Collection"
2. **Test Chat**: Use `/simple-chat` for best experience
3. **Verify**: Check console logs for AI classification debug info

### Current URLs
- **Live Site**: https://jaq-movie.vercel.app
- **Simple Chat**: https://jaq-movie.vercel.app/simple-chat (recommended)
- **Admin Panel**: https://jaq-movie.vercel.app/admin
- **Styled Chat**: https://jaq-movie.vercel.app/chat (styling issues)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical (Blocking Deployment)
- [ ] **Shell Environment**: Git push failing due to zsh snapshot error
- [ ] **Quote Escaping**: Fixed in code, needs manual git push

### UI/UX Issues
- [ ] **Complex Styling**: HeroUI interface has layout problems
- [x] **AI Classification**: Fixed pattern matching for "feeling like sci-fi"
- [x] **Vanilla Interface**: Created simple-chat as fallback

### Enhancement Opportunities
- [ ] **Real AI Integration**: Replace pattern matching with Claude/OpenAI
- [ ] **Voice Input**: STT for voice recommendations (future)
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Genre-based recommendations
- [ ] **Social Features**: Friend connections and sharing

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Deployment)
1. **Manual Git Push**: Fix quote escaping and deploy
2. **Test Import**: Run admin import for Jaq's collection
3. **Verify Chat**: Test conversational interface

### Short Term (Features)
1. **Improve AI**: Integrate real LLM for better classification
2. **Fix Styling**: Either fix HeroUI issues or standardize on vanilla
3. **Enhanced Responses**: Better movie filtering and recommendations

### Long Term (Vision)
1. **Real-time Sync**: Notion ↔ Database synchronization
2. **Advanced AI**: Context-aware conversations with memory
3. **Social Platform**: Multi-user with friend recommendations
